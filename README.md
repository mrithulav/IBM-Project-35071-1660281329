## $\color[RGB]{168,109,156} INTRODUCTION:$

        ⦿ Humans are able to recognize body and sign language easily. This is possible due to the combination of vision
    and synaptic interactions that wereformed along brain development . In order to replicate this skill in computers, 
    some problems need to be solved: how to separate objects of interest in images and which image capture technology and 
    classification technique are more appropriate, among others.

        ⦿ In this project Gesture based Desktop automation ,First the model is trained pre trained on the images of different
    hand gestures, such as a showing numbers with fingers as 1 ,2,3,4 . This model uses the integrated webcam to capture the video
    frame. The image of the gesture captured in the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the gesture is identified. 
    If the gesture predictes is 1 then images is blurred;2, image is resized;3,image is rotatedm etc.

## $\color[RGB]{168,109,156} PROJECT \ OBJECTIVE:$
**By the end of this project you will**

    ➼ Know fundamental concepts and techniques of Convolutional Neural Network.

    ➼ Gain a broad understanding of image data.

    ➼ Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data preprocessing techniques.

    ➼ Know how to build a web application using Flask framework.
   
## $\color[RGB]{168,109,156} PROJECT \ FLOW:$

    ⦿ User interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input

    ⦿ Depending on the different gesture inputs different operations are applied to the input image.

    ⦿ Once model analyses the gesture, the prediction with operation applied on image is showcased on the UI.

**To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below**

    ➼ Data Collection.

        ⦿ Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

    ➼ Data Preprocessing.

        ⦿ Import the ImageDataGenerator library
        ⦿ Configure ImageDataGenerator class
        ⦿ Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset

    ➼ Model Building

        ⦿ Import the model building Libraries
        ⦿ Initializing the model
        ⦿ Adding Input Layer\
        ⦿ Adding Hidden Layer
        ⦿ Adding Output Layer
        ⦿ Configure the Learning Process
        ⦿ Training and testing the model
        ⦿ Save the Model

    ➼ Application Building

        ⦿ Create an HTML file
        ⦿ Build Python Code


## $\color[RGB]{168,109,156} PROJECT \ STRUCTURE:$
**Create a Project folder which contains files as shown below**

    ⦿ Dataset folder contains the training and testing images for training our model.
    ⦿ We are building a Flask Application which needs  HTML pages stored in the templates 
       folder and a python script app.py for server side scripting
    ⦿ we need the model which is saved and the saved model in this content is gesture.h5
    ⦿ The static folder will contain js and css files.
    ⦿ Whenever we upload a image to predict, that images is saved in uploads folder.
